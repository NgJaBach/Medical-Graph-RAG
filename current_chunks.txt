Propositions:
    -This is a 72-year-old female patient with a complex medical and surgical history.
    -She presented following a fall suffered overnight, resulting in a right intertrochanteric femur fracture.
    -Her past medical conditions include paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mellitus, osteoarthritis, lumbar degenerative joint disease, and right foot drop.
    -She has a pacemaker and a history of coronary artery disease, for which she underwent coronary artery bypass grafting.
    -Her medications include Lipitor, amiodarone, metoprolol, glyburide, Accupril, NPH insulin, Coumadin, and Diovan.
    -Her vital signs on admission were blood pressure 171/64 mmHg, pulse 70 beats per minute, respiratory rate 19 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 97% on room air.
    -Physical examination revealed no signs of acute distress, with a normal cardiovascular and lung exam, but notable right leg shortening and external rotation, consistent with a femur fracture.
    -Laboratory studies showed a white blood cell count of 9.4, hemoglobin 14.5 g/dL, hematocrit 43.5%, and normal electrolyte and renal function parameters.
    -Imaging confirmed the diagnosis of a right intertrochanteric fracture with associated lesser trochanter fracture, and a CT of the head showed no intracranial hemorrhage.
    -The patient was prepared for surgical intervention, undergoing open reduction and internal fixation of the femur, with intraoperative stability achieved and no complications.
    -Postoperative management included transfer to the surgical intensive care unit, with cardiology consultation recommending fluid management adjustments, diuretics, and encouragement of incentive spirometry.
    -On postoperative day two, her condition remained stable, with acceptable hematocrit levels, INR 1.4, and no new complaints or signs of infection or cardiopulmonary compromise.
    -Her surgical wound was clean and intact, and neurovascular status of the extremity was preserved.
    -Physical therapy was initiated, and plans included full weight-bearing on the right leg, continuation of anticoagulation therapy with Coumadin, and scheduled follow-up with orthopedic specialists.
    -Discharge instructions emphasized mobility, wound care, medication adherence, and INR monitoring, with arrangements made for outpatient follow-up and home health services if needed.
    -Overall, her condition improved, and she was considered stable for discharge to her residence or rehabilitation facility, with ongoing medical management for her chronic conditions.
